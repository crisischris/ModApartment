Name: Chris Nelson
Hours taken to complete: about 15 hours.  I played around a lot with the design and other elements
Thing I like: watching everything come together for an actual deliverable that I made!
Challenging aspect: learing workflow between my 3d modeler (skp) and unity.  also materializing everthing.  Lighting/audio was fun as well

Submitting for Android.


note, cardboard sdk does not appear under player settings > other settings > Virtual Reality Supported.  I have read this is a bug in Unity 5.5
